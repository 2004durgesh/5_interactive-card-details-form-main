# Frontend Mentor - Interactive card details form
## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹
Good [Morning/Afternoon],  I'm thrilled to present my completed project: the Interactive Card Details Form. It's a web app that lets users fill in their card details and see real-time updates. The form validates inputs and displays error messages when needed. The layout adjusts for different screen sizes, and interactive elements have hover, active, and focus states. Thank you for your attention!

## User Requirements

Your users should be able to: 
- Fill in the form and see the card details update in real-time
- Receive error messages when the form is submitted if:
  - Any input field is empty
  - The card number, expiry date, or CVC fields are in the wrong format
- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover, active, and focus states for interactive elements on the page

### Expected behaviour

- Update the details on the card as the user fills in the fields
- Validate the form fields when the form is submitted
- If there are no errors, display the completed state
- Reset the form when the user clicks "Continue" on the completed state


**Have fun building!** ðŸš€
